          I do cloud infrastructures ‚Äî
          I make them work, work right, work well, work cheap ‚Äî
          in that order!

          This section is a kind of a professional one-pager
          (for a 6-pager, see my <a href="#contact" class="nav-link-inline">CV</a>)
          and an attempt to illustrate what drives me as an engineer.

          I started out in web development in the early 2000s but
          eventually turned to systems engineering after realizing
          I was more interested in other forces at play in
          blue-sky infrastructure ‚Äî
          self-service models,
          virtualization &amp; elastic capacity,
          service oriented architectures,
          distributed &amp; self-healing systems,
          consistency vs availability tradeoffs,
          etc were all enablers but the combined utility of these
          eluded all but the biggest companies in the pre-cloud era.

          Seeing these enablers packaged up as clouds and commoditized to
          the extent that the majority of players in every vertical are
          now cloud natives is testament to a universal need for
          dependable infrastructure as a consumable.

          Yet cloud platforms offer more than just a means to offload burdens
          to the provider, the adoption of cloud best-practices shapes a

          >necessary antifragility</a> for consumers ‚Äî
        advancing this agency for business advantage in systems is my
        core area of interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          My career prologue with code means I'm still a
          software engineer of sorts.
          When I am not

            >fighting fires</a>

          "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7514660-i-am-not-a-visionary-i-m-an-engineer-i-m-happy"
              >pothole problems</a>" with
          <a href="https://github.com/shalomb">code</a>
          to improve infrastructure state of play.
          I am a keen proponent of
          <a href="https://devops.com/why-the-buzz-on-software-defined-everything-sdx/"
            >Software-Defined-Everything</a>
          and evangelize
          <a href="https://devops.com/infrastructure-as-code-and-six-key-automation-concepts/"
            >Infrastructure-as-Code</a>
          engineering to manage all aspects of infrastructure.
          It's the oft-repeated clich√© but would I rather work to
          <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/agents-of-automation/568795/">
            automate myself out of a job</a> than find myself applying any amount of
          <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define:elbow%20grease">
            "elbow grease"</a> (ü§ñ)
          but the nature of cloud-native interactions also means
          developing solutions and
          <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">grappling with code</a>
          is a necessary prerequisite for economic reasons and so is an
          advantage that I am always keen on furthering.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm an
          <a href="/cv/#core-competencies">infrastructure jack-of-all-trades</a>
          but building and managing production systems is where my heart is,
          that makes me less of an AppOps and more of an
          <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/">SRE</a>
          or
          <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/category/production-engineering/">PE</a>
          (or apply trendy <em>mot du jour</em> here).

          Improving systems for
          change, operations, reliability,
          monitoring and feedback loops,
          putting out fires,
          automating processes &amp; tackling technical debt, etc
          are some activities wherein I see engineering antifragility actually happen.

          I do however take a keen professional interest in in and
          can apply myself in most DevOps areas along the pipelines i.e.
          proactive &amp;

          shift-left
          </a> approaches to nipping production problems in the bud ‚Äî
          right-sizing changes,
          <a href="https://devops.com/continuous-testing-vs-test-automation/">
            CT-centric </a> CI/CD,
          DevSecOps,
          rainy-day testing.

        <p>
          Where fitting, I'm also interested in the ‚Äúhands-off‚Äù albeit
          essential work in this domain ‚Äî
          solution/process design,
          architecture,
          project delivery,
          tech ownership,
          tech culture,
          etc (some of these seems contra-agile but ask me
          why agile delivery in the infra space requires
          <em>following a plan over responding to change</em>).
        </p>

        <p>
          Agile, code, economics,
          continuous experiental learning &amp; improvment ‚Äî
          these are my elements in the endeavour of
          dependable and flexible infrastructures to
          garner happy smiles all around. üòäüòäüòä
