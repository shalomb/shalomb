        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I do systems/infrastructures - I make them work, work right, work well.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm still writing this page up but in the meantime,
          here's a list of various roles I have held over 15 years both in
          big enterprises as well as small software houses.
        </p>

        <p>
          What gets me going is really the concept of <em>Software-Defined-Everything</em>
          which encompasses most the above job functions approached from a
          software engineering perspective. I write code to do systems!
