        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I do cloud infrastructures - I make them work, work right, work well.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm still contriving this homepage so in the meantime, here's a one-pager
          of what defines me professionally and I've done over some 15 years
          in big enterprises as well as small software houses (find my CV under the Contact section).

        <p>
          I turned to systems and infrastructure engineering many years ago
          after starting out in software development but realizing
          I was more interested in the other intriguing forces at play -
          distributed systems, reliability,
          networking, storage, automation,
          etc.
          I'm still a software engineer of sorts as I am a keen proponent of
          <a href="https://devops.com/why-the-buzz-on-software-defined-everything-sdx/">
            Software-Defined-Everything</a>
          and gravitate towards software engineering practices with
          <a href="https://devops.com/infrastructure-as-code-and-six-key-automation-concepts/">Infrastructure-as-Code</a>
          to build and manage infrastructure.
          Not only would I rather work to
          <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/agents-of-automation/568795/">
            automate myself out of a job</a> than find myself applying any amount of
          <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define:elbow%20grease">
            "elbow grease"</a> (ðŸ¤–)
          but the nature of cloud-native interactions also means
          developing and
          <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">grappling with code</a>
          is a necessary prerequisite and an advantage that
          I am always keen on improving.
        <p>
          Functionally, I'm an SRE or PE or (Infra|Sys|Dev)Ops
          (or whatever trendy <em>mot du jour</em> applies)
          as managing reliable production systems is my calling
          but I take a keen professional interest and
          can apply myself in most areas on the road to production i.e.
          <a href="https://www.securityroundtable.org/to-improve-devops-and-security-the-time-has-come-to-shift-left/">
          shift-left
          </a>/proactive problem-avoidance engineering -
          <a href="https://devops.com/continuous-testing-vs-test-automation/">
            CT</a>-centric CI/CD,
          DevSecOps, rainy-day testing, integrations, observable infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where fitting, I'm also interested in the "hands-off" work
          in this domain (kind of Anti-Agile but needed here IMO) -
          solution &amp; process design,
          architecture,
          technical leadership,
          agile ownership &amp; delivery,
          etc.
          All with the primary goal of continually improving on
          business excellence - reliable yet flexible systems,
          happy customers and blue skies.
