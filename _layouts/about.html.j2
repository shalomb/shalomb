        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
          I do cloud infrastructures â€” I make them work, work right, work well.
        </p>

        <p>
          This homepage is still being contrived so in the meantime, here's a
          one-pager (the 6-pager version is my <a href="#contact" class="nav-link-inline">CV</a>)
          of what defines me professionally and some of the things
          I've done over some 15 years working in various big enterprises
          and smaller software houses.

          I turned to systems and infrastructure engineering many years ago
          after starting out in software development but realizing
          I was more interested in the other intriguing forces at play
          in virt/cloud platforms â€”
          self-service models,
          service/resource oriented architectures,
          distributed self-healing systems,
          consistency vs availability tradeoffs,
          efficient/elastic resource utilization,
          etc are often after-thoughts but as important as the products you
          build for blue-sky operations.

          The initial prologue with code means I'm still a software engineer of
          sorts. I fully buy-into and am a keen proponent of
          <a href="https://devops.com/why-the-buzz-on-software-defined-everything-sdx/">
            Software-Defined-Everything</a>
          and gravitate towards software engineering practices and
          <a href="https://devops.com/infrastructure-as-code-and-six-key-automation-concepts/">Infrastructure-as-Code</a>
          to manage infrastructure and related activities.
          It's an oft-repeated clichÃ© but not only would I rather work to
          <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/agents-of-automation/568795/">
            automate myself out of a job</a> than find myself applying any amount of
          <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define:elbow%20grease">
            "elbow grease"</a> (ðŸ¤–)
          but the nature of cloud-native interactions also means
          developing and
          <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">grappling with code</a>
          is a necessary prerequisite and an advantage that
          I am always keen on furthering.
        <p>
          By profession, I'm an SRE or PE or ProductionOps
          (or whatever trendy <em>mot du jour</em> applies today)
          as managing reliable production systems is my calling.
          I do however take a keen professional interest and
          can apply myself in most areas on the road to production i.e.
          <a href="https://www.securityroundtable.org/to-improve-devops-and-security-the-time-has-come-to-shift-left/">
          shift-left
          </a> approaches to nipping problems in the bud â€”
          <a href="https://devops.com/continuous-testing-vs-test-automation/">
            CT-centric </a> CI/CD,
          DevSecOps, rainy-day testing, observable infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where fitting, I'm also interested in the "hands-off" albeit
          essential work in this domain â€”
          solution &amp; process design,
          architecture,
          technology ownership,
          project delivery,
          etc (these can seem contra-agile but ask me about 
          why agile delivery in the infra space requires
          <em>following a plan over responding to change</em>).
          The primary goal is continually improving on
          business excellence â€” reliable yet flexible systems and
          smiles all around. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
