        <p>
          I do cloud infrastructures ‚Äî
          I make them work, work right, work well, work cheap ‚Äî
          in that order!

          This section is a kind of a professional one-pager
          (for a 6-pager, see my <a href="#contact" class="nav-link-inline">CV</a>)
          and perhaps a little about what drives me as an engineer.

          I started out in web development in the early 00's but
          turned to systems engineering after becoming more interested
          in other forces at play in blue-sky infrastructure ‚Äî
          virtualization &amp; elastic capacity,
          self-service models,
          service oriented architectures,
          distributed &amp; self-healing systems,
          consistency vs availability tradeoffs,
          etc were all enablers but the combined utility of these
          eluded all but the biggest companies in the pre-cloud era.

          Seeing cloud providers then package up and commoditise these to
          the extent that players in every field are
          increasingly cloud-native is testament to a universal need for
          dependable infrastructure as a consumable and a platform.

          Yet cloud platforms offer more than just a means to offload complexity
          to the provider, their adoption shapes a

          >necessary antifragility</a> for consumers ‚Äî
          engineering systems around this agency for business advantages
          is my core area of interest.

        <p>
          I do DevOps but I'm an
          <a href="/cv/#core-competencies">infrastructure jack-of-all-trades</a>
          and building and operating infrastructures is where my heart is ‚Äî
          that makes me less of an AppOps and more of an
          <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/">SRE</a>
          or
          <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/category/production-engineering/">PE</a>
          (or insert trendy <em>mot du jour</em> here).

          Improving systems <em>
          <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/architecting-for-the-ilities-6fae9d00bf6b?gi=7a9689ab0cc5">
          -ilities</a></em>
          in a broader culture of closing &amp; tightening loops
          has a natural side-effect of improved antifragility.
          This is the area of infrastructure engineering
          I am inclined towards ‚Äî the means to the greater end.

          I do however take a keen professional interest in and
          can apply myself in most DevOps areas along the pipelines i.e.
          proactive
          <a href="https://www.securityroundtable.org/to-improve-devops-and-security-the-time-has-come-to-shift-left/">
          shift-left
          </a> approaches to nipping production problems in the bud ‚Äî
          right-sizing changes,
          <a href="https://devops.com/continuous-testing-vs-test-automation/">
            CT-centric </a> CI/CD,
          pipeline design,
          DevSecOps,
          rainy-day testing.

        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not
          <a href="http://www.felicepescatore.it/alm/140-firefighter-agile-anti-pattern-eng"
          >busy in production</a>
          I like engineer away
          "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7514660-i-am-not-a-visionary-i-m-an-engineer-i-m-happy"
              >pothole problems</a>" with
          <a href="https://github.com/shalomb">code</a>
          and contribute to better infrastructure state of play
          (I'd ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è if my work was entirely open source).

          I am still a developer of sorts given my early career prologue
          with code and perhaps this defines what SREs are ‚Äî
          tamers of systems using software engineering principles.

          I am a keen proponent of
          <a href="https://devops.com/why-the-buzz-on-software-defined-everything-sdx/"
            >Software-defined-everything</a>
          and evangelize Infrastructure-as-Code
          engineering to manage all aspects of infrastructure.

        <p>
          Where fitting, I'm also interested in improving the ‚Äúhands-off‚Äù albeit
          instrumental work in this domain ‚Äî
          systems analysis,
          solution &amp; process design,
          architecture,
          agile delivery,
          tech culture,
          etc (some of these seem contra-agile but ask me
          why agile delivery in infra requires
          <em>following a plan over responding to change</em>).
        </p>

        <p>
          Agile, software engineering, economics,
          experiental learning &amp; continuous improvment ‚Äî
          these are my elements in the endeavour of
          dependable and flexible infrastructures.
