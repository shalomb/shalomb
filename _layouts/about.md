About Me
========

I do cloud infrastructures — making them work, work right, work well,
work cheap — in that order!

This page here is a bit of a professional one-pager (for a 6-pager, see
my [CV](#contact){.nav-link-inline} .. and no I don't work for Amazon).

Perhaps a little about what drives me as an engineer.

- Production Engineering — SRE/CRE, (Sys|Infra)Ops, Automation, Problem Management
- Cloud Engineering — Private/Public Cloud IaaS/PaaS design, IaC, Workload Migrations
- Systems Development — UNIX/Linux, Python, Golang, Shell, Windows Core, PowerShell
- DevOps — CI/CD + CT, Build & Release Engineering, Dev(Sec|Test)Ops, QA/QE
- Ecosystems — Platforms, Bespoke Services, APIs & Integrations, Tooling

I've  worked in various technology settings over 17 years --
in  content & web development, SOHO infrastrcture & networking,
QA automation, systems admin & engineering, DevOps/SRE,  cloud infra.

After university the first time, I tried my hand at programming but the appeal
of web development didn't take my fancy. I was more interested in the
backends and the things behind the scenes that make things work ---
networking,  virtualization  &  elastic
capacity, self-service  models, service oriented architectures,  distributed &
antifragile systems,  etc. These didn't have the modern labels we assign them
today but being business enablers,  their combined  utility  eluded  all but  the  biggest
companies  in the  pre-cloud era.  Seeing cloud  providers now  package-up and
commoditise these  to the extent  that players in  every field are  by default
cloud-native is  testament to a  universal need for  dependable infrastructure
not just as a  consumable but a platform. Yet cloud  platforms offer more than
just a  means to offload complexity  to the provider, their  adoption shapes a
[necessary
antifragility](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050914007017/pdf?md5=579fbbe1aa1f4e10e7ad57bc2d5535e9&pid=1-s2.0-S1877050914007017-main.pdf)
for consumers --- engineering systems with this agency at the core,
for continuous improvement, is my main professional interest.

I do DevOps but I'm mostly an [infrastructure
jack-of-all-trades](/cv/#core-competencies) and building and operating
infrastructures is where my heart is --- that makes me less of the
[AppOps](https://medium.com/@mhausenblas/what-is-appops-why-do-i-care-what-i-do-about-it-b83a28b0eabc)
kind and more of the [SRE](https://landing.google.com/sre/) or
[PE](https://engineering.fb.com/category/production-engineering/) (or
insert trendy *mot du jour* here) type that is more interested in where
_RFCs 1918 or 6749_ apply than what new javascript framework is going to
change the world.
Engineering systems
*[-ilities](https://towardsdatascience.com/architecting-for-the-ilities-6fae9d00bf6b?gi=7a9689ab0cc5)*
is important for how well services run and fostering this quality
in a business culture of closing/tightening loops has a natural
side-effect of improved antifragility --- the setting of I am inclined towards.
I do however take a keen professional interest in and can
apply myself in most "DevOps" areas along the pipeline e.g. proactive
[shift-left](https://www.securityroundtable.org/to-improve-devops-and-security-the-time-has-come-to-shift-left/)
approaches to nipping production problems in the bud --- right-sizing
changes,
[CT](https://devops.com/continuous-testing-vs-test-automation/)-centric
CI/CD, pipeline design, DevSecOps, rainy-day testing, etc.

When I am not [busy in
production](http://www.felicepescatore.it/alm/140-firefighter-agile-anti-pattern-eng)
I like engineer away "[pothole
problems](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7514660-i-am-not-a-visionary-i-m-an-engineer-i-m-happy)"
with [code](https://github.com/shalomb)
and contribute my part to better
infrastructure state of play (I'd ❤️ if more of my work was open source).
I am still a developer of sorts given my early career prologue
with code and perhaps this defines what SREs are --- tamers of systems
using (mostly) software engineering principles. I am a keen proponent of
[Software-defined-everything](https://devops.com/why-the-buzz-on-software-defined-everything-sdx/)
and evangelize Infrastructure-as-Code to be the authority that controls
all aspects of infrastructure.

Where required, I also play a part in the "hands-off" albeit
instrumental work in this domain --- systems analysis, solution &
process design, architecture, agile delivery, tech culture, etc (some of
these seem contra-agile but ask me why agile delivery in infra requires
*following a plan over responding to change*).

Agile, software engineering, economics, experiental learning &
continuous improvment --- these are my elements in the endeavour of
dependable and flexible infrastructures. **٩(⁎❛ᴗ❛⁎)۶**
