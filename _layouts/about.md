About Me
========

I'm an Engineer based out of Bratislava, Slovakia but I originally hail from
England. I've lived here with my family for close to 10 years.

I get a thrill out of crafting cloud solutions — making them [work right,
well, cheap](https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast) — in
_roughly_ that order!

My professional specializations are in

- Cloud Engineering — AWS Well-Architected Cloud Solutions, Infrastructure-as-Code, SRE
- Platform Engineering — Self-Service/DevEx Platforms, Bespoke Tooling & Automation
- DevSecOps — CI/CD/CT, Continuous Delivery, Build & Release Engineering
- Solutions Development — API Engineering, Python, Golang, Linux, Windows Core

I advocate for the effective use of DevOps, Agile and Design Thinking methods
where [customer needs are put at the
core](https://www.inc.com/john-koetsier/why-every-amazon-meeting-has-at-least-one-empty-chair.html)
and therefore the technologies and delivery methods we employ, as
shiny/clever/important as they may be, matter less than the customer outcomes.

I am a keen proponent of the [software-defined-everything](
https://devops.com/why-the-buzz-on-software-defined-everything-sdx/) and
evangelize code-centricity as an important underpinning of a DevOps
organization -- This makes me a software-engineer-of-sorts who gravitates to
solving infrastructural challenges in code (but knows when to exercise a
_build-vs-buy_ option or trade an infrastructure option for bespoke code). As
a corollary, I have a preference for utilizing tried/tested/"[Boring
Technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)" to cultivate
healthy
[-ilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes)
that dependable systems should exhibit.

While I specialize in Cloud Engineering and Infrastructure DevOps, this
would be incomplete without the complimentary activities that make for
effective solutions engineering -- I'm at home around customers, teamwork,
culture, code, architecture, product backlogs, production incidents, etc.

I cherish walks the outdoors with my wife and
daughter. I enjoy fitness sports and can often be spotted on a gravel bike
around the gravel roads of neighbouring Burgenland in Austria or tackling the
single-tracks of the _Male Karpaty_ hills on a mountain bike. A solid Zone 4
workout is my idea of good hard fun. **٩(⁎❛ᴗ❛⁎)۶**
